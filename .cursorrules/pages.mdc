# Pages

- Define page entries in `src/ui/navConfig.tsx` with: `key`, `title`, optional `hotkey`, and `component`.
- Page component conventions:
  - Call `useFocusRegion('page:<key>', true)` at top-level to claim page focus.
  - Keep side-effects in hooks; avoid side-effects during render.
  - Scope keyboard handling to page-specific actions; do not re-implement global navigation.
- Keep pages small and delegate shared behaviors to contexts or small components (e.g., `FocusTextInput`).
