# Lint

- Base: ESLint flat config with JS, TypeScript, React, and import plugins.
- Important rules:
  - `no-console`: warn (allowed for progress/errors in CLI).
  - React 19: `react/jsx-uses-react` and `react/react-in-jsx-scope` are off.
  - TypeScript unused-expression rules are off to allow Ink patterns.
- Resolver uses TS project; keep path aliases in sync with `tsconfig.json`.
- Lint scripts:
  - `npm run lint` (no warnings allowed when gatekeeping)
  - `npm run lint:fix`
