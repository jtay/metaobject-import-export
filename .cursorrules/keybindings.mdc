# Keybindings

- Global (handled in `AppLayout`):
  - Tab cycles pages when no focus region is active.
  - Esc or Ctrl+G gives focus to navbar and clears page focus.
  - Cmd+<hotkey> jumps directly to a page without focusing the navbar.
  - Single alphanumerics map to pages by `hotkey` when global hotkeys are enabled.
- Navbar-focused behavior:
  - Left/Right to move hover; Enter or Tab selects hovered.
  - Alphanumeric hotkeys also work while navbar is focused.
- Page behavior:
  - Define page-local bindings (e.g., Import preview scroll) within the page.
  - Do not bind global navigation inside focused regions.

- Letter hotkeys: single alphanumerics map to pages when no modifiers pressed.
- Reserved: arrows, Shift+*, Ctrl/Cmd/Alt combos for future features.
- Do not bind global hotkeys inside focused regions.
