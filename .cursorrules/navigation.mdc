# Navigation

- Use `useNavigation().navigate(key)` to request a page change.
- `NavigationProvider` emits `{ key, seq }`; consumers compare `seq` to react once per request.
- Prefer requesting navigation from event handlers (e.g., Enter on a selected item) rather than during render.
- Keep page keys in `src/ui/navConfig.tsx`. Hotkeys map to these keys.
- Avoid storing a second copy of the current page in other contexts; source of truth is `AppLayout`.
