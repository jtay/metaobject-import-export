# Code Style

- TypeScript, strict mode. Prefer explicit types on exported APIs; allow inference locally.
- Avoid 1–2 character names. Use descriptive identifiers (Clean Code style).
- Use early returns and guard clauses. Avoid deep nesting (>2–3 levels).
- Keep side-effects in hooks (`useEffect`) and async functions; avoid in render.
- Keep components small; extract helpers to `src/utils/*` or small components under `src/ui/components/*`.
- Do not add explanatory comments inside code just to narrate actions; favor readable code.
- Preserve indentation style per file; do not mix tabs/spaces.
- Prefer multi-line readability over complex one-liners.
