# Environments

- `.env*` files are discovered in the project root at startup (`listEnvFiles`).
- Selecting an environment loads it via `dotenv.config({ path })` and locks selection for the session.
- To create a new environment, use the UI flow in `NewEnvForm` which reads keys from `example.env` and writes `.env.<name>`.
- Required variables for Shopify client:
  - `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`
  - `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` (or `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
- Do not mutate environment variables outside of context initialization.
