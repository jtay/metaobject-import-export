# Focus

- Mount `FocusProvider` once at the app root.
- Use `useFocusRegion(id, enabled)` for interactive widgets and pages to request focus.
- Use `FocusTextInput` for text inputs so they participate in focus and disable global hotkeys.
- Global hotkeys are disabled whenever any focus region is active; only page-local handlers should fire.
- Call `useFocusContext().clearFocus()` or press Esc/Ctrl+G at layout level to return focus to navbar.

- Use `useFocusRegion(id, enabled)` to claim focus when interactive widgets are active.
- Use `FocusTextInput` wrapper for text inputs to auto-disable global hotkeys while focused.
- Global hotkeys are disabled when any focus region is active.
