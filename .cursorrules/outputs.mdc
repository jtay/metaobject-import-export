# Outputs

- Output files are in `outputs/` under project root.
- Discovery reads file stats and if `.json`, parses via `parseExportFile` to extract `environment` and top 5 types by count.
- When env is missing, try inferring by matching known env names within filename.
- Sort results descending by `createdMs` then by name.
- `Home` shows columns: File, Type (ext), Environment, Created, Types (preview).
